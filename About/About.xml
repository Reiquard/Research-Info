	<description>	Research bench is no longer just a cumbersome object - now it shows useful info about currently performing research.
	
You don't need to open research window or to recall to find what kind of research is being performed - all you have to do is just click on that bulky thing called "research bench" and you will see the title, progress and even estimated time* to complete current project.
*Estimated time only shown when research is actually being performed.

For more detailed information, open the "Project" tab attached to the bench.
